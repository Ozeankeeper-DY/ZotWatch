# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Removed `scoring.rerank.enabled` configuration flag. Reranking is now automatically enabled when `scoring.interests.enabled=true` and disabled otherwise. This simplifies configuration by eliminating redundant flags.

**Migration:**

Remove the `enabled` field from your `config.yaml`:

**Before:**
```yaml
scoring:
  rerank:
    enabled: true  # Remove this line
    provider: "voyage"
    model: "rerank-2.5"
```

**After:**
```yaml
scoring:
  rerank:
    provider: "voyage"
    model: "rerank-2.5"
```

**Impact:**
- Provider coupling validation now only runs when `interests.enabled=true`
- Configs with `interests.enabled=false` no longer require matching providers
- This eliminates confusing validation errors for unused rerank configurations
